    <h2 class="h2">WHAT IS FORTNITE?</h2>
    <p class="whatisfortnite">Fortnite is an online video game and game platform developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available in six distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative hybrid tower defense-shooter and survival game in which up to four players fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with traps and fortifications they can build; and Fortnite Creative, in which players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas, Lego Fortnite, Rocket Racing and Fortnite Festival.</p>
    <h2 class="dailytop">DAILY UPDATES</h2>
    <p class="dailyupdates">We make sure to update this site whenever a new update is released by Epic Games. With the OG Fortnite season being launched a few days ago, the game is dropping new loot pools and places on the map. Our website will provide gamers with all the information they need to know about new updates being launched every week. This website will provide quick information and images divided into the three most important subsections of the videogame: MAP, WEAPONS, SKINS. As well, we also provide a fourth page: ABOUT US. Where I explain my credentials and background information about my experience with Fortnite Battle Royale.</p>
