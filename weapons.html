     <h4 class="h4weapons">The Anvil Rocket Launcher made an appearance in the trailer for Chapter 3: Season 2 prior to being added in Content Update v20.00.
        The Anvil Rocket Launcher works very similar to the real life FGM-148 Javelin, a portable anti-tank missile system which also fires a rocket directly upwards before landing straight down onto its target.
        The Anvil Rocket Launcher will make an alarm sound whilst the rocket is traveling to its location.
        This weapon was invented by The Paradigm and produced by The Scientist which was confirmed in Week 3's Resistance Quests by The Imagined.
        The Anvil Rocket Launcher's name is a shortened phrase for Anti-Vehicle Rocket Launcher.
        The name could also be a pun on how the rockets dive to their target is similar to an Anvil falling from a high place.</h4>
