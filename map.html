        The Evolution Of The Fortnite Map
    </h2>
    <p class="evolutiontext">  
        Since Season 1 in 2017, the Fortnite Battle Royale map has changed a lot. At first, it had places like Pleasant Park and Tilted Towers. But Epic Games kept updating it to keep the game fun. The map saw big events like meteors hitting Dusty Depot and turning it into Dusty Divot. Places like Greasy Grove and Moisty Mire also came and went. Different events, like the cube moving around and the iceberg hitting the island, changed the map's shape and added new spots to explore. The map changes also connect with Fortnite's story. Each season has its own theme and events, like rifts appearing or aliens invading. These changes don't just change how the map looks. They also affect how the game is played and how players work together. As the map keeps changing, players are excited to see what new adventures come next on the island.
